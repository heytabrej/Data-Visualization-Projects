# Data Visualization Project

This GitHub repository contains a data visualization project focused on analyzing and visualizing three distinct datasets: Health Data Analysis, Indian Liver Patient Records, E-commerce User Behavior, and Weather Prediction. These datasets provide valuable insights into various domains, and the visualizations aim to help understand the data better.

## Project Overview

As part of a project assigned by a professor, you have the opportunity to explore and visualize data from different sources. This project encompasses the following datasets:

### 1. Health Data Analysis

This section of the project deals with health data analysis. The dataset(s) used in this section are intended to provide insights into health-related trends and patterns.

### 2. Indian Liver Patient Records

The "Indian Liver Patient Records" dataset is a significant part of the project. It focuses on liver patient records and aims to extract valuable information from this healthcare dataset.

### 3. E-commerce User Behavior

This section of the project focuses on the analysis of user behavior in e-commerce. It utilizes the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" to understand user behavior and predict their purchasing intentions.

### 4. Weather Prediction

The "Weather Prediction" segment of this project involves the analysis and visualization of weather prediction data. This dataset is used to create visualizations that help in understanding weather-related patterns.

## Data Visualization

The core of this project is data visualization. The repository includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that utilize popular data analysis and visualization libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more to generate insightful plots, charts, and graphs.

## Usage

You can explore the data visualization code and results for each of the datasets in the respective project folders. Feel free to run the scripts, analyze the visualizations, and adapt the code for your specific needs.
